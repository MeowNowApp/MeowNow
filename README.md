# MeowNow ðŸ˜¸

A simple and elegant web application for displaying and sharing random cat images using AWS S3 for storage.

## Features

- **Random Cat Display**: Shows random cat images from your S3 bucket
- **Simple Interface**: Clean, responsive design that works on all devices
- **Image Upload**: Users can upload their own cat photos directly to S3
- **On-the-fly Compression**: Uses AWS Lambda to compress images when they're accessed
- **EXIF Orientation Fix**: Automatically corrects image orientation based on EXIF data
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Press spacebar to show another cat
- **Fallback CSS**: Multiple layers of CSS fallback to ensure the site always looks good
- **Cloud Storage**: Uses AWS S3 for reliable, scalable image storage

## AWS Architecture

### S3 Storage

Images are stored in Amazon S3, providing durable and scalable object storage.

### Lambda Image Processing

The application uses AWS Lambda for on-the-fly image compression and processing:

1. Original images are uploaded directly to S3
2. When an image is requested, a Lambda function is triggered
3. The Lambda function retrieves the original image, compresses it, and returns the optimized version
4. Processed images can be cached for improved performance

This serverless approach eliminates the need for server-side compression during upload and allows for dynamic resizing and optimization based on the requesting device.

## Environment Variables

This application uses environment variables for configuration.  Refer to the `.env.example` file for the recommended configuration.

## Directory Structure

- `index.html` - Main page that displays random cat images
- `script.js` - JavaScript for fetching and displaying cat images
- `style.css` - Main stylesheet
- `backup.css` - Fallback stylesheet if the main one fails to load
- `upload.php` - Handles image uploads to S3
- `list.php` - Returns a JSON list of available cat images from S3
- `cat_list.json` - Local cache of uploaded images (fallback for S3)
- `logs/` - Directory for log files
- `vendor/` - Directory for Composer dependencies (AWS SDK)

## Image Upload

The application allows users to upload their own cat photos with the following features:

- Supports JPG and PNG formats
- Maximum file size: 50MB per file, 250MB total per upload session
- EXIF orientation correction
- Unique filename generation to prevent conflicts
- Direct upload to S3 with public-read ACL

## Browser Compatibility

MeowNow works on all modern browsers including:

- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox
- Apple Safari
- Microsoft Edge

## Performance Optimizations

- CSS and image preloading
- Multiple CSS fallback mechanisms
- Next image preloading for faster browsing
- Cloud-based image storage for reliability and performance
- Serverless image processing with AWS Lambda:
  - On-demand compression reduces storage requirements
  - Dynamic resizing based on client device capabilities
  - Caching of processed images for faster subsequent access
  - Reduced load on the web server by offloading image processing
  - Automatic scaling to handle traffic spikes
