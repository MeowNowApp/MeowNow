andom Cat Picture Website

This is a personal project for hosting a website that displays a random picture of my cats on each page refresh. The images are served from the `./cats` directory, and the site uses basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP to make it work.

## How It Works
- **Random Image Selection:** JavaScript fetches a list of images from a PHP script and selects one at random to display.
- **Dynamic Updates:** Any `.jpg` or `.png` files added to the `./cats` directory are automatically included.

## File Overview

```
RandomCat/
├── index.html       # The main webpage
├── style.css        # Basic styling for the page
├── script.js        # Handles fetching and displaying random images
├── list.php         # Generates a list of image files in the cats directory
└── cats/            # Where all the cat images are stored
```

## Purpose
The site is hosted locally (or on `cats.wbreiler.com`) and is just for fun—a way to share random pictures of my cats with anyone visiting.

## Notes
This isn't intended as a replicable project but rather a personal way to showcase my cats!
